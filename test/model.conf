# This file provides a basic configuration for defining the request and policy structure, 
# specifying the policy effect, and defining the matching condition between requests and policies. 
# This configuration is then used by the Casbin library to perform access control decisions based on the defined policies and the incoming requests.


#Request definition
[request_definition]
r = sub, obj, act

#Policy definition
[policy_definition]
p = sub, obj, act

#Policy effect
# This determines the overall decision when multiple policies match a given request. In this case, it uses the 
# `some` keyword and a condition to evaluate whether any of the matching policies have an effect (p.eft) of `allow`.
# If at least one policy allows the access, the overall decision is considered allowed.
[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

#Matchers
[matchers]
m = r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act
